                <p> An ancient being waking from its infinite slumber; a teenage boy watching his childhood hero 
                    die in live television; a gentle breeze carrying the neatly folded goodbye of a muse's defeated 
                    lover. Are the fantastical worlds we discover in daydreams simply just fleeting thoughts - 
                    or are they also stories we tell to protect ourselves from the hurt we refuse to confront?</p>
                <p> <i>Microheartaches</i> is a collection of poems and short stories that tread in the boundary 
                    between the real and mystical, trying to make sense of life and death and what it's all supposed 
                    to mean. It is also an expression what we desperately want to reveal - a love letter to ourselves 
                    and to the world.</p>
                <p> If you ever find yourself lost in thought, keeping busy in the things that make you forget about 
                    everything else in the world - maybe you have microheartaches of your own too. And maybe you 
                    should start to figure them out for yourself. At the end when you reach that restless heart, 
                    maybe you'll find the things that truly matter.

                <p>
                    Carlos Salazar is a highschool student from Quezon City. Beneath the skies of Dumaguete
                    where he was born, he had his first encounters with the mystic anomalies from the land beyond ours;
                    reaching into our world and changing his life forever. To him, writing about himself in third-person 
                    is painfully weird but he guesses this is how authors are talked about in the backs
                    of books, so he'll continue. <i>Microheartaches</i> is his first published written work.
                    Aside from writing, Carlos also draws, sings, makes music, tries to be good at <i>Valorant,</i> 
                    and lives in constant dread of a STEM curriculum he didn't know was going to be this exhausting.
                    But he's alright.
